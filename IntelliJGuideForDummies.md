# How to mod Minecraft the easy way For Dummies 

Today I will teach you how to make your own mod in minecraft versions (1.14.* {Fabric} & 1.16.5 {Forge}) and onwards.

This does not teach you how to install or play Minecraft, I'm pretty sure we all learned that at a early enough age.

## Instructions

### [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
First we are going to need our [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for making the mod IntelliJ Idea Community Edition. This is the main program for making mods for minecraft.

>Head to the [downloads section](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) on the Intellij website. Make sure to install the Community Edition as the Ultimate Edition is a 30 day free trial.

Run the idealC-(yourversion).exe and make sure to accept the Admin Prompt.

You can pick any location you prefer or just use the default location when it prompts you.

I personally use a custom location on my dev drive but this is not needed.
On the next page of the installer I highly recommend these options as the default is none.

Then continue with the install as normal.
